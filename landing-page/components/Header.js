The projected yields (7-30%) are dependent on option liquidity and counter-parties which are not assured. Lack of Transparency: Key operational details such as ARB option liquidity, allocation splits, and execution mechanisms are insufficiently detailed or publicly verifiable. Better to wait: The TMC believes it's prudent to hold the ARB tokens and revisit deployment with more robust proposals later. Edit V3 clarified the decision and feedback: The TMC provided specific feedback to both Karpatkey and Avantgarde on their respective strategies, citing concerns about the scalability of covered call strategies, the minimal yield of lending-based approaches, and the lack of real-world liquidity data for large ARB notional amounts. Voting NO means the ARB รฐ will be held and the RFP process will be re-held in 3 months."

Currently, the bridge doesn't route these tokens through the Sky Custom Gateways, resulting in a suboptimal user experience and the deactivation of bridging USDS/sUSDS through the UI. Updating the router will ensure users get the official USDS and sUSDS tokens when bridging through the Arbitrum Bridge UI. The Sky Custom Gateways are already live, audited, and allow for future token support and upgrades. The proposal involves calling the `setGateways` method on the L1GatewayRouter contract on Ethereum and requires collaboration between the Sky team and Offchain Labs. There are no direct costs associated with the proposal beyond the required technical effort."
